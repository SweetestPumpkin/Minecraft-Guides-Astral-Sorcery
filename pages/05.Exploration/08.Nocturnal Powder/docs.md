Using the Illumination powder you can also create Nocturnal powder. When right-clicked on the ground it will create a dark patch which will eventually disappear leaving behind a group of mobs. The mobs spawned will vary per biome and the mods installed. If the mobs inside are somehow continuously removed (e.g. killed or pushed out of the area), more mobs will spawn inside the smoke.!
