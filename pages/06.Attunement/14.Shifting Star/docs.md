If you ever want to change your Attunement for whatever reason then you will need to craft a Shifting Star. This can be used just like a bow (it will draw back and then break) and will clear your Attunement. This will undo all your progress with that attunement. Some of these attunements will take some time to progress through so make sure you are 100% sure you want to clear your attunement.
