There are some perks that might not come in so handy and might be rather annoying depending on your circumstances. The Seal Sigal is here to help and will let you BLOCK one of the perks, this works by disabling the perk but still makes the book think you have spent a perk point so you can move further into the tree.

In the top left of the Perks page is the  amount of Sigils you have, you just need to drop these onto a perk you do not want to be active, you can always enable these again by double clicking:
