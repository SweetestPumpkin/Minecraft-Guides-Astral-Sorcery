The Domic Resonator is the first upgrade from you standard Fosic Resonator. This Domic Resonator can be used to show the range of rituals and other items by drawing a huge dome. 

With the below Ritual pedestal it is impossible to see the range of the Ritual but using the Domic Resonator (right click the Pedestal) you will be given a visual guide:

This green dome is the range of the Ritual, the only way to remove this dome is to step out of it or to use the Domic Resonator on a something else (like a Tree Beacon). This can be very useful when trying to see how far a ritual goes. This can also be used on the Tree Beacon.
